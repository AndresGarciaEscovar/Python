# Python Codes - Instructions
These programs were written using Python 3.5. Sample files are provided
for programs that require the use of external files. Since the files are
pre-configured, changing the format of the files will result in the
programs not running properly. For further instructions, refer to the
manuals.

The programs require the use of tkinter, random, time, scipy, numpy and
sys.

The programs show how the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm works on a
simple one-dimensional diffusion problem, where a cell cannot contain
more than one particle at a time. There are two kind of algorithms, one
algorithm that allows move rejection r_simp_AB.py, and another that
only allows valid moves, or a rejection free algorithm nr_simp_AB.py.

For a better description of the program, see the manuals for the simple
A -> B model manual sqrt0_simpleAB_1D.pdf for the description of the
problem (located in the section for the C/C++ programs).
